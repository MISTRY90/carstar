        <p>Pagani Automobili S.p.A. (commonly referred to as Pagani) is an Italian manufacturer of hypercars and carbon fiber components. The company was founded in 1992 by the Argentinian Horacio Pagani and is based in San Cesario sul Panaro, near Modena, Italy.
        </p>
        <p>Horacio Pagani, who formerly managed Lamborghini's composites department, founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new company worked with Lamborghini on numerous projects, including the restyling of the Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary Edition, the Lamborghini LM002, the P140 design concept, and the Diablo. In the late 1980s, Pagani began designing his own car, then referred to as the "C8 Project". Pagani planned to rename the C8 the "Fangio F1" to honour his friend, the Argentinian five-time Formula One champion, Juan Manuel Fangio.
        </p>
        <p>In 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being tested at the Dallara wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, Mercedes-Benz agreed to supply Pagani with V12 engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3 million dollars.
        </p>
        <p>In 2005, Pagani announced that it planned to triple its production output within the next three years, and to enter the US market in 2007. On 30 June 2010, Pagani claimed a new record for production-based cars using the Pagani Zonda R and completing the Nürburgring in 6:47, beating the Ferrari 599XX.Pagani's first model, the Zonda, is powered by a mid-mounted DOHC V12 engine manufactured by Mercedes-Benz's AMG division. The car's design was inspired by jet fighters and the famous Sauber-Mercedes Silver Arrow Group C cars, and features several unique design elements, including its circular four pipe exhaust system.
        </p>
        <p>The Pagani Huayra, a successor to the Pagani Zonda, was initially revealed online in a press release on January 25, 2011. It was officially revealed at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The car is named after the Incan god of wind, Huayra-tata.[7] The engine is a 6.0-litre twin-turbo M158 V12 engine from Mercedes-AMG producing 544 kW (740 PS; 730 hp)[8] and 1,000 N⋅m (740 lb⋅ft) of torque.[8] The Huayra's body is made from carbotanium; a lightweight composition of carbon fibre and titanium. The Huayra has been redesigned from the ground up, but shares many visual qualities with its predecessor. The car can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.2 seconds and has a top speed of 235 mph (378 km/h). Only 100 units of the Huayra were produced, each costing £1,000,000 without options.</p>

        <h2>Pagani Logo</h2>
        <p>
            The logo bears the complete name of its company and was designed in a more stylish way unlike other car logos. It completely presents prestige through its metallic badge. It shows an idea of being proud of its roots by having a large “P,” complete PAGANI name at the middle and an automobile Modena that says it all.

            <h4>2009 Pagani Zonda GJ</h4>
            <p>The Zonda GJ was commissioned by a Scottish entrepreneur Gareth Jones whose Zonda S heavily crashed in 2009.
                Apparently, the Zonda was originally built as a base C12 Coupe, but after what we can imagine to be excessive enjoyment, the owner sent the Zonda back to Pagani to get some repairs done, including the installation of the automaker’s more powerful “F” performance package.</p>

            <h4>2010 Pagani Zonda Uno</h4>
            <p>After honoring the Frecce Tricolori, Pagani is off to meeting the demands of the Royals of the Gulf. The Al Thani family which is ruling Qatar since 1825 commissioned Pagani to build them a custom supercar in an emetic shade of turquoise. Pagani immediately set to work on this one-off creation and presented the family with their very own custom version of the Zonda, dubbed the Uno.

            <h4>2010 Pagani Zonda Tricolore</h4>
            <p>This first car was built as a one-of for the Spanish importer Guarnieri. Like the Cinque editions that were built for a Hong Kong dealership, the Tricolore has numerous special features including the flappy-paddle gearbox from X-trac. The car uses tinted carbon fibre much like the Veyron Grand Sport ‘Sang Bleu’ released in 2009. This new Zonda also has upgrades from both the Cinque and Zonda R.</p>

            <p>This one-off Pagani Zonda is based on the 760 RS model and pays tribute to the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Unlike other special edition Zondas, the LM has revised headlamps (only Zonda which has different headlights) and an even bigger rear spoiler than the original 760RS. The LM also has the tricolore stripes depicting the Italian flag on the right side of the bonnet and the German flag on the other side.

            <p>A matte-black, right hand drive Cinque roadster. This was an F that was crashed, and therefore upgraded to pretty much the Cinque spec, switching to the 670bhp V12 and going from a manual to a paddleshift. The Pagani Zonda Absolute was shipped to Hong Kong. The car was then upgraded into the Absolute Evolution in 2018. It features a bare carbon fibre body finished in a matte black color along with Italian tri-color stripe in the centre.</p>

                Today, images and information that were exclusive to print media surfaced online and we can now present the Pagani Huayra. Similar in design to the Zonda, the Huayra uses a Mercedes-sourced engine which has been developed in cooperation with AMG. It’s wrapped in an entirely new chassis which is shorter and made with some of the same techniques as the Zonda R.
