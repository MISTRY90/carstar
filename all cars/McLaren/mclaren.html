        <p>McLaren Automotive (formerly known as McLaren Cars) is a British luxury automotive manufacturer based at the McLaren 
           Technology Centre in Woking, England. The main products of the company are supercars, which are produced in-house in 
           designated production facilities. In July 2017, McLaren Automotive became a wholly owned subsidiary of the wider McLaren Group.
        </p>

        <p>McLaren Automotive replaced McLaren Cars in 2010. McLaren Cars had been founded in 1985[4] and released the McLaren F1 
            in 1992. Between 1994 and 2010, McLaren Cars was registered as a 'dormant company', before the founding of McLaren 
            Automotive in 2010. The new company was originally separate from the existing McLaren companies to enable investment in 
            the new venture, but was brought together in July 2017 after Ron Dennis sold his shares in McLaren Automotive and McLaren 
            Group.
        </p>
        <p>McLaren's Formula One founder Bruce McLaren was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1937.[5] McLaren learned about cars and 
            engineering at his parents' service station and workshop in his hometown, Auckland, New Zealand. By 15, he had entered a 
            local hillclimb in an Austin 7 Ulster; winning his first race in the car.[6] In 1958, McLaren arrived in the United Kingdom 
            with the ‘Driver to Europe’ scheme, intended to help Australian and New Zealand racers to compete in Europe. His mentor,
            Jack Brabham introduced him to Cooper Cars, a small team based in Surbiton, Surrey. Auspiciously starting his Formula One 
            career in 1958, McLaren joined the Formula One team a year later. That same year, he won the US Grand Prix at age 22, 
            making him the youngest Grand Prix winner to that date.[7] He stayed with Cooper for a further seven years, winning three 
            more Grands Prix and other races, driving for Jaguar and Aston Martin, & winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966 with Ford.
        </p>
        <p>McLaren founded Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in 1963. A year later, the company built the first McLaren race car – the M1A; 
            24 were produced. Its successor, the M1B, allowed McLaren into the Can-Am championship and emerged the dominant victor 
            with 43 victories, almost three times more than rival Porsche.[8] In 1965, the first McLaren Formula One car, the M2B, 
            debuted at the Monaco Grand Prix.
        </p>
        <p>In 1980, the company merged with Ron Dennis’ Project 4 Racing team. The merger brought back designer, John Barnard, 
            interested in using carbon fibre composite. Carbon fibre was already used in aerospace applications but had never been 
            applied to a complete racing car monocoque. McLaren pioneered the use of carbon fibre in motor racing with its new car, the MP4/1,
            bringing new levels of rigidity and driver safety to Formula 1. In August 1988, Dennis, Team Principal and Gordon Murray started 
            to develop a new car and in 1992, the F1 was launched with a total production run of just 106 units.

        <p>
            McLaren officially says “The revamped logo that first appeared in 1997 featured a streamlined speedmark which bares
            similarities to the vortices created by our rear wing. It appeared on the top of our cars’ side-pods. They evoke aggressive
            markings found on predatory animals and insects.”

            <h4>McLaren Artura</h4>
            <p>Every drop of McLaren’s technical expertise and experience has been channeled into making the all-new Artura 
                extraordinary to drive and wonderfully enjoyable to own. Ever since the 12C revolutionized the supercar segment
                a decade ago, McLaren Automotive has continued to push the boundaries of supercar innovation. The McLaren P1™ 
                brought McLaren hybridization to the hypercar sector as long ago as 2012.

            <h4>McLaren Senna GTR</h4>
            <p>McLaren Automotive is the most extreme track car yet revealed in final form. It's evolution of 2018 McLaren Senna
                GTR Concept takes acknowledged McLaren Senna dynamism into new realms of performance as the quickest track McLaren outside of Formula 1. It's faster, lighter, more powerful and race-bred with focus on accessibility for drivers of all abilities.

            <h4>McLaren 765LT</h4>
            <p>As reported on AutoEvolution, the McLaren 765LT has finally had its starting price, and base specs finalized. There’s really no use beating around the bush. The 765LT will start at $358,000. In perspective, that is more than a Ferrari 812 Superfast or a Porsche 911 (992) Turbo S. It’s almost $100,000 more than a Lamborghini Huracán Evo. However, it does have a few tricks and treats for the lucky owner of one of the only 765 that will be made. </p>

            <h4>McLaren 620R</h4>

            <p>If you thought that the McLaren Sports Series was already at its peak, then you have another thing coming and that thing is the 620R. The car is basically a 570S GT4 race car for the road. It’s a limited-run coupe that McLaren will build only 350 of. The car is the most powerful of the Sports Series range, according to Carscoops.The vehicle features M838TE 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that is in the GT4 racing car.

            <h4>McLaren Elva</h4>
            <p>The McLaren Elva is the roofless supercar that dreams are made of. The Elva is joining the P1, Senna, and Speedtail at the top of the McLaren lineup and it looks absolutely amazing. Recently some new information came out about one of the best sunny weather cars in the world. 
            According to Evo, the McLaren factory will build 399 Elvas after the last Speedtail has left the facility. Each of those cars will come with a £1.4million ($1.9 million) starting price.</p>

            <h4>McLaren Senna</h4>
            <p>When it was first unveiled in late 2017, the Senna proclaimed itself as the ultimate street-legal McLaren. We can go back as early as the 1990s when tracing the Senna’s lineage, with the McLaren F1 pioneering the first production car with full carbon-fibre construction. More than two decades later, its predecessor – the McLaren P1 – gave the British automaker a refreshed sense of supremacy with its redesigned flagship car.</p>

            <h4>McLaren 720S Spider</h4>
            <p>Late in 2018, McLaren unveiled its latest iteration of the current 720S – monikered “Spider” as is tradition, this is a convertible variant of the 720S which comes with a folding hard top. For the better and most part, the Spider retains the same DNA as the Coupe, utilizing a modified version of its carbon fibre tub chassis – called Monocage II-S – which accommodates the new folding roof and its mechanism.

            <p>Meet the new Speedtail – an aptly-named addition to McLaren’s Ultimate Series. This limited-edition car, of which only 106 examples will be built, represents McLaren’s unyielding pursuit of top-speed.
