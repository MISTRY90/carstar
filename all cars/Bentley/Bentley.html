        <h1>BENTLEY</h1>
        <p>Bentley Motors was founded by W.O. Bentley. The first car to bear his name pulled out of New Street Mews, London in 1919. From modest beginnings, the company moved from strength to strength – in a relentless pursuit of both luxury and performance.

            Were it not for the brand’s five victories at Le Mans in the 1920s, plus a sixth in 2003, this combination could be seen as a contradiction in terms. In which case, it could be said that Bentley continues to create the most acclaimed contradictions on the road today.</p>
        
        <p>In 1923 W.O. worked with ‘Bentley Boy’ John Duff, to prepare his Bentley and lent him the Bentley Works driver Frank Clement for the 24-hour endurance race. W.O. travelled to see the race and it was then W.O. claims Le Mans got into his blood.

            Bentley’s racing success was achieved by thorough preparation and the ability to continuously learn from experiences. Each year Bentley improved their engines, pit procedures and team discipline.
            
            And so, at 4pm on Sunday June 15, two Bentley Speed 8s came first and second at Le Mans, almost 83 years to the day that the two Speed Sixes had achieved the same. It was a day that those who witnessed it will never forget.</p>
        <p>The following Wednesday, the number 7 Speed 8 was guest of honor at a celebration dinner held at the Savoy in London, the same venue and identical menu and drinks list as the Le Mans dinner in 1927.

            Since then Bentley has made some of the most desirable road machines. Whether it is the glamour, speed and power of the pre-war Bentley era or the imposing ‘Blower’ Bentley with it's 4 ½ Litre Supercharged engine that went like a rocket, there is no shortage of amazing road cars from this brand.

        <h2>The Bentley Logo</h2>
        <p>
            The Bentley car symbol is uncomplicated and elegant, but also full of meaning. The bold ‘B’ pays homage to the founder of this historic auto company, symbolizing his indelible mark on the automotive world. The wings that accompany the W.O.’s namesake offer a meaning that is two-fold.
