        <h1>BMW</h1>
        <p>Not everybody knows that BMW started as a manufacturer of aircraft engines. In October 1913 Karl Friedrich
            Rapp establishes "Rapp-Motorenwerke" in a former bicycle factory near Munich.

            Rapp was an engineer who arise through the Daimler system and "Rapp-Motorenwerke" was set up as a subsidiary
            of "Flugwerk", an airplane maker. He starts manufacturing his own aircraft engines but unfortunately they
            suffered from problems with vibrations.

            In 1917, BMW's first aircraft engine, the Type IIIa, goes into production. It is a water-cooled six-cylinder
            inline engine, it features a unique "high-altitude carburetor" developed by chief engineer Max Friz that
            allows it to develop full power at altitude. Max Friz was a grand engineering mind who would dominate BMW's
            product development culture on into the 1960's.

            BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1929 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time,
            built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.</p>

        <p>BMW's team of engineers progressively developed their cars from small Seven-based cars into six-cylinder
            luxury cars and, in 1936, began production of the BMW 328 sports car. Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and
            automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II.

            During the war, against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine
            production, with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether.

            Towards the end of 1930, BMW attempted to introduce a new front axle with independent wheel suspension for
            both their models, the BMW 'Dixi' 3/15 DA4 and BMW 'Wartburg' DA3, but this resulted in accidents with the
            prototypes because of construction faults.</p>
        <p>However, as the license with Austin would end in 1932, BMW decided upon the development of a completely new
            model and called in the help of German engineer Josef Ganz. He was hired as a consultant engineer at BMW in
            July 1931.

            At first, Josef Ganz negotiated with BMW about possible manufacture of his innovative rear-engined Maikäfer
            prototype at BMW. However, BMW decided for a different model, more along the lines of the previous Dixi
            model. Therefore, with the assistance of Ganz, work started on the development of the BMW AM1, a small car
            with a front-mounted engine, rear-wheel drive, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles.

            <h4>BMW M3 COMPETITION</h4>

            <p>
                The M3 is BMW’s most iconic driver’s car, and the current model shows that the company still remembers
                what made many previous M cars instant favorites. The standard version of the current M3 is a rear-drive
                473-hp sedan available only with a six-speed manual transmission. Opt for the 503-hp M3 Competition, and
                you’ll have to settle for an eight-speed automatic. The M3 Comp is available with either rear- or
                all-wheel drive, and its track-tuned chassis is stiff-riding to the point of being close to a race
                car-like experience. All M3s are quick: in our testing, the rear-drive Competition model’s 60-mph time
                of 3.5 seconds was 0.4 seconds quicker than our long-term base car’s.

            <h4>BMW M4 COMPETITION</h4>
            <p> s the two-door version of the M3 sedan, the M4 has high levels of comfort, luxury, and daily
                usability—and a reasonably roomy rear seat should you need them. Power and grip are two areas where the
                BMW M4 shines. The standard M4 comes with rear-wheel drive, a six-speed manual transmission, and a fiery
                473-hp twin-turbo inline-six engine; M4 Competition models have 503 horsepower. Both models can be had
                with an optional eight-speed automatic, the only transmission sold with the optional xDrive
                all-wheel-drive system. There’s even a new track-attack version, the 543-hp M4 CSL that deletes the rear
                seat for weight saving.

            <h4>BMW M2 CS</h4>

            <p> Though it shares its bones with the regular BMW 2-series, the 2023 M2 takes that car’s already
                impressive performance and turns the heat way up. Not only does it have a racier appearance and a
                specially tuned chassis, but its twin-turbocharged inline-six pumps out 453 horsepower—just 20
                horsepower shy of the output of the M3’s standard engine. Like the previous M2, the new one employs
                rear-wheel drive and comes with a standard six-speed manual transmission, so we’re hoping it also
                preserves its predecessor’s delightful driving behavior.

            <h4>BMW i4 M50 xDrive</h4>
            <p> The all-electric BMW i4 sedan is an important piece of BMW’s expanding EV portfolio. It offers the style
                of the 4-series Grand Coupe with a battery powertrain and highly refined road manners. There are three
                distinct i4 flavors: The first two are single-motor rear-drive, with the eDrive35 offering 281
                horsepower and 260 miles of EPA range, while the eDrive40, produces 335 horsepower with an estimated 300
                miles of driving. That figure drops to 245 miles in the spicy, all-wheel-drive, 536-hp i4 M50. The
                latter drives like a better-riding M3, which is a mega compliment.

            <h4>BMW i8</h4>

            <p>Hybrid sports cars are increasingly common thanks to electricity's performance-enhancing qualities, but
                the 2020 BMW i8 is more about looking fast than going fast. Still, the BMW provides a show-stopping
                entrance regardless of whether its dihedral doors open on the hardtop coupe or convertible roadster.
                While its plug-in powertrain is respectably powerful—and quicker than lesser hybrids—you're more likely
                to see one tear around a Whole Foods parking lot than your local racetrack. A user-friendly ride and
                comfortable front seats make the 2020 i8 usable every day; however, its limited storage space and
                compromised cabin access might cross it off most people's list.

            <h4>BMW X5 M</h4>
            <p>The X5 M is an ultra-high-performance SUV that uses the same twin-turbo V-8 as BMW’s most powerful sedan,
                the M5. The X5 comes standard with 600 horsepower but adding the optional Competition package unlocks an
                additional 17 ponies and other racy hardware such as an M Sport exhaust and sport seats. The X5 M tips
                the scales at 5489 pounds, but thanks in part to a balanced 50/50 weight distribution, it exhibits
                impressively controllable behavior around even the most challenging road courses. Off the track, the X5
                M uses its SUV scale as an advantage to comfortably seat up to five.

            <h4>BMW X6 M</h4>

            <p> The unusually-shaped BMW X6 M packs a vicious 600 horsepower from its twin-turbo V-8 and sends that
                muscle through a rear-biased all-wheel-drive drivetrain. Moving this mountain of M-power is a posh
                affair thanks to an elegant, high-tech interior with lavish standard equipment and near-perfect
                fit-and-finish. The X6 M’s sticky performance summer tires and stiffly-sprung chassis produce a harsher
                ride than in the standard X6, and BMW turns the volume up even higher on its exciting mid-size luxury
                SUV with an optional Competition package that adds 17 horsepower, a rowdy M Sport exhaust, and sport
                seats. Other SUVs such as the Porsche Cayenne Coupe and Mercedes-AMG GLE-class have followed the X6’s
                sloping-rear-roofline look and, like the X6 M, prioritize style over maximum rear storage space.

            <h4>BMW M5 CS</h4>

            <p>Some cars are big-bodied and some are thrilling. The BMW M5 is both, with a body based on the regular
                5-series and a heart-and-lung transplant courtesy of the brand’s M performance division. Under the hood
                lives a spectacular 600-hp twin-turbo V-8 bolted to an eight-speed automatic transmission that powers
                all four wheels. An optional Competition package turns up the heat with 17 extra horsepower, a more
                soulful exhaust, stiffer suspension, and Competition badging and trim. That version rocketed to 60 mph
                in 2.8 seconds in our testing. Built to handle the rigors of mountain hairpins, blasts on the autobahn,
                and everyday life the M5 offers a premium experience with a penchant for fireworks.

            <h4>BMW iX</h4>

            <p>BMW's electrified future is previewed by the 2023 iX SUV, which offers similar space and practicality as
                the brand's popular X5, but with cutting-edge flair. Two electric motors provide all-wheel drive and
                more than ample power—516 hp in the xDrive50 and a whopping 610 hp in the M60—while a large battery pack
                delivers enough juice for an estimated driving range of over 300 miles per charge. The iX's spacious
                interior is lined with fine materials and features a fancy, futuristic design; a large digital dashboard
                displays the future of BMW's iDrive infotainment system and is controlled by a cool see-through rotary
                knob on the center console.
