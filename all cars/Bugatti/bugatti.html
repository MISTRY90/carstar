        <h1>BUGGATI</h1>
        <p>Born in Milano, Italy, 1881, Ettore was the son of Carlo Bugatti who not only worked as a painter but also as a silversmith, sculptor and woodworker. By the age of nineteen, Ettore Bugatti had just completed building his first real car. He nailed it. His automobile seemed almost futuristic. The auto featured a four speed gearbox, a four-cylinder overhead-valve engine and a variety of engineering improvements that only a gifted builder could have come up with.

            In 1909, receiving financial support from banker de Vizcaya, Ettore Bugatti purchased a large property in Molsheim, on the German territory of Alsace. Soon after his newly acquired factory, Ettore decided to go a step further and built a small, lightweight racing machine to compete in the Le Mans race.
            
            Although it looked like a four wheeled dwarf as compared to its giant competitors’ cars such as a Fiat, De Dietrich and others, the little but swift and powerful automobile came in second proving that Ettore was a more talented car designer as compared to many of the older engineers at the time. The year was 1911.</p>
        
        <p>Three years later, the war came and Ettore, much like the majority of car builders, had to redistribute his attention to the much needed aircraft engines. As soon as the war was over, Ettore resumed his work and soon became a ‘baron’ leading a baroque lifestyle that earned him the title of ‘Le Patron’.

            In 1922, Bugatti introduced a revolutionary car shaped like a cigar (Type 29/30) which featured hydraulic brakes and the manufacturer’s first eight-cylinder engine.
            
            Dubbed “the Cigar” the car made its debut at the AFC grand prix in 1922 and took second place. One year later, Bugatti introduced the Type 32 which caused sensation due to its wing-like design, short wheelbase and covered wheels. The Type 32 was dubbed “the Tank” and boasted a redeveloped version of the previous 8-cylinder engine.</p>
        <p>In 1924 Bugatti entered the Type 35 in the French Grand Prix held in Lyon. While the car’s design turned to its time’s traditional open-wheels design, the Type 35 retained the previous 8-cylinder engine and steadily became the car to beat for the next decade.

            Most people know Bugatti as a car company because of their awesome Bugatti Veyron. With a 16-cylinder quad-turbo engine, it blew the doors off every top speed record known.

            <h4>Bugatti Veyron 16.4</h4>
            
            <p> 
                The development of the Bugatti Veyron represented one of the greatest technical and engineering challenges ever overcome in automotive history,” the company says. They are right. At the time, Bugatti engineers had to surmount an amazing number to technical issues in order to build a car capable of hitting 250 mph+ and be able to do it in comfort and elegance in accordance with the brand values. The car had to transfer more than 1,000 hp onto the road, achieve a top speed in excess of 250 mph, accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in less than three seconds and still be suitable for ‘driving to the opera’ in comfort and style.

            <h4>Bugatti EB110 SS </h4>
            <p> The original Bugatti EB110 debuted on September 15th, 1991 – the date of company founder Ettore Bugatti’s 110th birthday. But it wasn’t until almost a year later that Bugatti unleashed the full potential of the EB 110’s quad-turbocharged 3.5-liter V12. The 603-horsepower (449-kilowatt) EB110 Super Sport (or, SS) showed face for the first time at the 1992 Geneva Motor Show.
           
                Visually, not much changed over the standard EB110. The SS model didn’t lose the conventional 110’s Marcello Gandini-designed flat and broad characteristics, especially on the front fascia, but gained some additional aerodynamic cues.

            <h4>Bugatti La Voiture Noire</h4>
            
            <p> The one-off project called the Bugatti La Voiture Noire is built on the Chiron platform but is so special and unique it commands a $18.9 million price tag. With its homage to the fourth, all-black Atlantic, missing since WWII, the brand is bringing the tech, luxury and aesthetics of an icon into a new era.

            <h4>Bugatti Divo</h4>
            <p> Three very important things to note about the car: purchasing one will cost $5.8 Million USD, only 40 are being produced, and they’re already sold out. The Divo shares most of the important mechanical features with the Chiron; most notably the same quad-turbocharged 8.0L W16 engine which produces an extravagant 1,500 horsepower.

            <h4>Bugatti 16/4 Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse ‘La Finale’</h4>
           
            <p>There were a lot of special edition Veyron’s built between 2005 and 2015 and while the initial 16.4 makes our list, the level of development over the years means we wanted to add another deserving Veyron to our list. While the “Legends” were cool and the updates we also awesome, we feel like the final Veyron, the Grand Sport Vitesse ‘La Finale’ is exactly that, the finale, the ultimate Veyron.

            <h4>Bugatti Chiron</h4>
           <p>With the Chiron, Bugatti has developed the world’s most powerful, fastest, most luxurious and most exclusive production super sports car. With a power output of 1,500 hp, unprecedented for a production vehicle, torque of 1,600 Nm at 2,000 to 6,000 rpm and many technical innovations, the Chiron sets standards in every respect. Its maximum speed, limited for road use, is 260 mph (although we know recently that a car specced like the upcoming Super Sport 300+ hit 305 mph). The Chiron is being produced in a limited series of 500 cars. The base price is about US$2.8 million.
