        <h1>LAMBORGHINI</h1>
        <p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian brand and
            manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the
            Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

            Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio
            Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine,
            rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of
            the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after
            1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and
            sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In
            1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the
            control of the group's Audi division.

            New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an
            increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the
            subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.

            Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán, along with the Urus
            SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat
            racing.

            Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy
            and continues to produce tractors. Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the
            automobile manufacturer.</p>


        <p>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of
            producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari.
            The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for
            the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.</p>

        <p>Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide
            financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and
            René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of
            brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. </p>

        <h2>The Lamborghini Logo</h2>
        <p>
            The Lamborghini logo color choice has changed a couple of times over the years. Most of the time, the
            company has experimented with monochrome versions of its logo. Occasionally, the brand looked at shades like
            red and white as a way to highlight passion and strength.

            The most common Lamborghini logo colors, however, are black and gold. The black of the shield behind the
            bull symbolizes sophistication, power, and status. It’s an extremely strong color choice.

            The golden elements of the Lamborghini logo are of course linked to luxury and wealth. They can also be
            connected with ideas of prestige and beauty.

            <p>The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engine sportscar produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer
                Lamborghini. In keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is named after a Spanish fighting bull
                that fought in Zaragoza, Aragón in 1993.[7][8][9] The Aventador is the successor for the Murciélago and
                was made by hand in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.
                Launched on 28 February 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show, five months after its initial unveiling in
                Sant'Agata Bolognese, the vehicle, internally codenamed LB834, was designed to replace the
                then-decade-old Murciélago as the new flagship model.</p>

                and was released in the market in the second quarter of 2014. The LP 610-4 designation comes from the

                which refers to the longitudinal mid-rear engine position.

                After four years, Lamborghini hit a major milestone, producing 20,000 of these SUVs, making the Urus the
                company's best-selling model in the shortest time.

            <h4>The Lamborghini Countach</h4>
            <p>The Lamborghini Countach is a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car produced by the Italian
                automobile manufacturer Lamborghini from 1974 until 1990. It is one of the many exotic designs developed
                by Italian design house Bertone, which pioneered and popularized the sharply angled "Italian Wedge"
                shape.

                The style was introduced to the public in 1970 as the Lancia Stratos Zero concept car. The first showing
                of the Countach prototype was at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show, as the Lamborghini LP500 concept.[7]

            <h4>The Lamborghini Sián FKP 37</h4>
            <p>The Lamborghini Sián FKP 37 is a mid-engine hybrid sports car produced by the Italian automotive
                manufacturer Lamborghini. Unveiled online on 3 September 2019, the Sián is the first hybrid production
                vehicle produced by the brand.
                The Sián FKP 37 is the first super sports car powered by a V12 engine and hybrid technology based on
                supercapacitors. Its powerful V12 engine, coupled with electric boost, creates an unrivaled gem of
                engineering and technology. Sián—lightning in Bolognese—is a name that captures the car’s true
                character, foremost its speed, which exceeds 220 mph (350 km/h).
                The Design DNA of Lamborghini is taken to its peak levels: inspired by the Countach, the Sián FKP 37 has
                sharp lines, aerodynamic elegance and an unmistakable silhouette.

            <h4>The Estoque</h4>
            <p>The Lamborghini Estoque is a one-off concept car built by Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini.
                Unlike almost all production Lamborghini models, which are mid-engine, two-seater sports cars, the
                Estoque is a four-door sedan.
                The Estoque was introduced at the 2008 Paris Motor Show.[4][5][6] The Estoque is the first front-engine
                vehicle to be introduced by Lamborghini since the LM002 utility vehicle. It was described as a "concept
                for a $230,000 four-door sedan".[7] It had a 5.2 litre V10 engine shared with the Gallardo, although
                there had been speculation that this would be replaced by a V12, V8, or possibly even a hybrid or a
                turbo-diesel engine, as suggested by the then Lamborghini Brand Director, Manfred Fitzgerald.
