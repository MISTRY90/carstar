    <h1>Rolls Royce</h1>
    <!-- article -->
    <article class="left">
        <p>When Henry Royce was designing the first Rolls‑Royce, a friend advised him to “turn out a reliable car at a
            low price”. But Royce had other ideas. He sought to turn out “the best motor car in the world regardless of
            cost”. More than 100 years later, that same desire for perfection is the driving force behind Rolls‑Royce
            Motor Cars.</p>

        <p>Since 1904, we’ve created instantly recognisable motor cars that have made the marque an icon all over the
            world.</p>
        <p>With a shared ambition to make the future of motoring extraordinary, the Honourable Charles Rolls and Sir
            Henry Royce joined forces in 1904. Despite being from very different backgrounds, the founders of
            Rolls‑Royce Motor Cars formed an unlikely partnership – one forged from a shared passion for engineering and
            a desire to create the Best Car in the World.</p>
        <p>Rolls and Royce first met on 4 May 1904 in Manchester. Within minutes of seeing Royce’s twin-cylinder 10hp,
            Rolls knew he had found what he was looking for. After taking the motor car for a drive, Rolls agreed on the
            spot to sell as many motor cars as Royce could build, under the name Rolls‑Royce.</p>
        <p>One of Johnson’s early adverts for the 40/50hp motor car promoted it as: ‘The six-cylinder Rolls‑Royce – not
            one of the best, but the Best Car in the World.’ In that moment, he had introduced the phrase that would
            forever be associated with Rolls‑Royce.</p>
        <p>Rolls‑Royce produced the 1907 Silver Ghost, the motor car that founded the marque’s legendary status.</p>
        <p>After faultlessly completing the 1913 Alpine Trial – a 14,371-mile drive through some of the toughest
            mountain terrain – the Silver Ghost had demonstrated such a level of comfort and reliability that critics
            named it ‘The Best Car in the World’. The rest as they say is history.</p>

        <h2>What Does The Rolls-Royce Logo Mean?</h2>
        <p>This sign is the bonnet decoration on Rolls-Royce vehicles. It represents the figure of a woman inclining
            forwards with the arms outstretched back from and above her. Rolling cloth runs from the woman’s arms to her
            behind, resembling wings.</p>

            <h4>Rolls-Royce Ghost V-Specification</h4>
            <p>At the heart of the Ghost’s driving experience is its hallmark V12 engine. Acceleration is delivered with
                a characteristic immediacy and smoothness, propelling occupants from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.7 seconds
                with 80% of power available from idle. This unique powertrain is celebrated with a 30bhp / 22kw power
                increase on all Ghost V-Specification motor cars.</p>

            <h4>Rolls-Royce Phantom Metropolitan Collection</h4>
            <p>The Phantom Metropolitan Collection pays homage to the world’s great metropolises through the meticulous
                application of marquetry – the art of inlaying small pieces of wood veneer to form decorative motifs.
                When open, Phantom’s signature picnic table presents occupants with an elevated view of the city,
                created through the expert application of 500 individual wood veneer pieces. Indeed, the process of
                hand-cutting, colouring, shaping and applying is so complex these unique objects d’art take an expert
                wood craftsperson several days to complete. On closing the tables, a different perspective of the
                cityscape is offered – reflecting the view one gets when effortlessly travelling in the rear of a
                Phantom.</p>

            <h4>Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé</h4>

            <p>On the move, the purpose-designed 6.75-litre V12 engine provides huge reserves of power and torque. The Rolls-Royce Phantom will accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds (0-100 kph 5.9 seconds) and on to a limited top speed of 149 mph (240 kph).

                Behind the wheel, the low-down torque wafts the Phantom swiftly yet effortlessly from tick-over. Peak torque is 720 Nm (531 lb ft) at 3500 rpm, but more importantly 75 per cent of that total is developed at just 1000 rpm. Maximum power is 460 PS (338 kW).</p>
