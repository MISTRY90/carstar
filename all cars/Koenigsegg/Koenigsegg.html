        <h1>KOENIGSEGG </h1>
        <p>The company was founded in 1994 in Sweden by Christian von Koenigsegg, with the intention of producing a
            "world-class" sports car. Many years of development and testing led to the CC8S, the company's first
            street-legal production car which was introduced in 2002.

            In 2006, Koenigsegg began production of the CCX, which uses an engine created in-house specifically for the
            car. The goal was to develop a car homologated for use worldwide, particularly the United States whose
            strict regulations did not allow the import of earlier Koenigsegg models.

            In March 2009, the CCXR was listed by Forbes as one of "the world's most beautiful cars".[3]

            In December 2010, the Agera won the BBC Top Gear Hypercar of the Year Award.[4]

            Apart from developing, manufacturing and selling the Koenigsegg line of sports cars, Koenigsegg is also
            involved in "green technology" development programmes beginning with the CCXR ("Flower Power") flex-fuel
            sports car and continuing through the present with the Jesko. Koenigsegg is also active in development
            programs of plug-in electric cars' systems and next-generation reciprocating engine technologies. Koenigsegg
            has also developed a camless piston engine which found its first application in the Gemera, which was
            introduced in 2020.[5]

            Koenigsegg develops and produces most of the main systems, subsystems and components needed for their cars
            in-house instead of relying on subcontractors.[6]

            In January 2019, Koenigsegg sold a 20% stake in the company to Swedish electric car manufacturer (Egstrand &
            Lundgren), National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), for US$171 million.[7]

            Koenigsegg has since then bought the stake back from NEVS and owns 100% of the company again</p>

        <p>The initial design of the CC was penned down by Christian von Koenigsegg. Industrial designer David Crafoord
            realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug
            for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went
            through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built.
        </p>


        <p>Christian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated
            movie Pinchcliffe Grand Prix in his youth.[11] He took his first steps in the world of business in his early
            20s running a trading company called Alpraaz in Stockholm, Sweden. Alpraaz exported food from Europe to the
            developing world. The success of this venture gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch
            his chosen career as a car manufacturer.
        </p>

        <p>Initially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in Olofström. In 1997, the company needed larger production
            facilities and moved to a farm, just outside Ängelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production
            facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his
            new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were
            converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active Ängelholm airport,
            clients can arrive by private jet nearby. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for
            shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.

            <ul>

                <li>Founded: 1994; 28 years ago</li>
                <li>Founder: Christian von Koenigsegg</li>

        <h2>The Koenigsegg Logo</h2>
        <p>
            After moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed the Swedish air force's "Johan Röd" squadron,
            Koenigsegg adopted the "ghost symbol" that the squadron had on their planes, which were Saab AJS37 Viggens
            aircraft (the squad also used the English phrase "The show must go on" on their aircraft as well) as a
            tribute to the squadron. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from their
            hangar.
            The badge that identifies the Koenigsegg car brand was conceived by designer Jacob Låftman. It is a shield
            based on the Koenigsegg family’s own coat of arms since the 12th century. The phantom insignia on the
            Koenigsegg logo is a tribute to the Swedish air force squadron that operates out of the airbase where
            Koenigsegg’s factory is also located (they use the ghost as their emblem).

            <h4>Koenigsegg Agera</h4>
            <p>The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg. It is a
                successor to the CCX/CCXR. The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means "to act" or in
                imperative form "(You) act!".</p>
            <p>
                It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by Top Gear magazine.[5] The Agera RS variant became the
                world's fastest production car in 2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top speed
                of 447 km/h (278 mph) and a fastest straight-line speed of 458 km/h (285 mph).[6]

                being the Roman numeral for ten) of the completion and test drive of the first CC prototype in 1996.
                The CCX was unveiled at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, sporting body modifications to meet US vehicle
                regulations and a new in-house developed 4.7L twin supercharged V8 engine capable of generating a
                maximum power output of 817 PS (601 kW; 806 hp) at 7,000 rpm and 920 N⋅m (679 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500
                rpm while running on 91 octane gasoline.

            <h4>The Koenigsegg Gemera</h4>
            <p>The Koenigsegg Gemera is a limited production four-seat plug-in hybrid grand tourer to be manufactured by
                the Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg. It was unveiled on 3 March 2020 at an online broadcast
                by Koenigsegg at the cancelled Geneva Motor Show.
                The engine is so small because it is a camless piston engine, the
                first such engine announced for a production car. Called the Tiny Friendly Giant (TFG), it displaces
                1988.25cc and has two turbos and three cylinders[a] driving the front wheels and charging the batteries.
                It is rated at 590 hp (440 kW) at 7500 rpm, with a redline at 8500 rpm, and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of
                torque from 2000 rpm to 7000 rpm.

                homage to the CC8S. Built to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first production CC8S, the CC850
                was originally limited to 50 units to celebrate the company's founder Christian von Koenigsegg's 50th
                birthday,[2] however, due to increased demand it was announced six days later on the 25th of August 2022
                that an additional 20 units would be built.
