        <h1>DODGE</h1>
        <p>Dodge is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles have historically included performance cars, and for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth. </p> 

        <p> Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John Francis Dodge in the early 1900s,[2] Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-based automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the "Dodge Brothers" brand in 1914, predating the founding of Chrysler Corporation. The factory located in Hamtramck, Michigan was the Dodge main factory from 1910 until it closed in January 1980. John Dodge died from the Spanish flu in January 1920, having lungs weakened by tuberculosis 20 years earlier.[3] Horace died in December of the same year, perhaps weakened by the Spanish flu, though the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver. Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. </p>
            
        <p> Dodge mainstay vehicles were trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, though it also built compact cars such as the 1963–76 Dart and midsize cars such as the "B-Body" Coronet and Charger from 1965–78. </p>
            
        <p> The 1973 oil embargo caused American "gas guzzler" sales to slump, prompting Chrysler to develop the Dodge Aries K platform compact and midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s. One example was the Dodge Caravan. During the 1990s the Dodge Stratus found many buyers along with the larger Dodge Intrepid. </p>
        <p> The Dodge brand endured multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its merger with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007,[4] its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management, its 2009 bailout by the United States government, and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat. </p>

        <p> In 2011, Dodge and its sub-brands, Dodge Ram and Dodge Viper, were separated. Dodge announced that the Viper was to be an SRT product, and Ram a standalone marque. In 2014, SRT was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, the Chrysler Group was renamed FCA US LLC, coinciding with the merger of Fiat S.p.A. and the Chrysler Group into the corporate structure of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Subsequently, another merger occurred on January 16, 2021, between FCA and the PSA Group (Stellantis), making the Dutch-domiciled automaker the second largest in Europe, after Volkswagen.

            Dodge is an iconic American car marque, which was founded in 1900 by the Dodge brothers to produce car components. Already in 1914,the company began the production of its cars. In 1928 Dodge was sold to Chrysler Corporation, which owns it to this day.Interestingly, John and Horace Dodgy were the first co-owners of Ford, so the brothers began a new business as professionals in the automotive industry.

            <h4>2024 Dodge Charger</h4>
            <p> 
                There's no better indication that electric vehicles are taking over than the 2024 Dodge Charger concept. Electrifying one of the brawniest muscle cars is a big undertaking, but it's one that comes with big performance payoffs. The next-generation Charger will likely ride on Stellantis's upcoming large electric vehicle platform which is said to deliver up to 500 miles of range. Of course, dialing up the performance to Hellcat levels will likely result in a lower range estimate </p>

            <h4>2023 Dodge Challenger </h4>
            <p> While rival muscle cars have pivoted recently toward sharp handling, the 2023 Dodge Challenger keeps things retro with a package that’s designed more for old-school pony-car jollies and straight-line speed. A V-6 engine is standard in these non-SRT Challengers but the real fun comes with the optional naturally aspirated Hemi V-8 engines, which are offered in a variety of displacements and outputs spanning a 375-hp, 5.7-liter to a 485-hp, 6.4-liter.

            <h4>2023 Dodge Charger SRT</h4>
            
            <p> One look at the 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat and you know that this four-door sedan is something very different. The current-generation Charger debuted for the 2005 model year, and since then Dodge has strapped more and more powerful engines to its chassis. A supercharged V-8 engine is under the hood of the latest versions and it makes at least 717 horsepower. Opt for a Redeye model and horsepower is boosted to 797—and with the Jailbreak package that number is an even more insane 807 ponies.

            <h4>2023 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat</h4>
            <p> 
                The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is where tires go to die. It’s one of the last coupes with American-style V-8 thunder under its hood. The Challenger SRT Hellcat lineup’s most reserved model spews 717 horsepower from its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine. But there’s so much more: output from the Hellcat Redeye model’s version of this engine jumps to 797 horsepower. And the meanest, nastiest Hellcat Redeye, the Widebody Jailbreak edition, deploys 807 horsepower.

            <h4>2023 Dodge Hornet </h4>
            <p> Dodge is poised to get back into the small crossover market with the 2023 Hornet. Rather than reskinning a Jeep Compass like it did with the unloved Caliber, this time around Dodge has instead settled on sharing a platform with a Stellantis-company cousin, the Alfa Romeo Tonale. A 265-hp turbocharged four-cylinder with all-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic is the standard setup but the R/T model is a plug-in hybrid with 285 ponies and more than 30 miles of electric driving.</p>

            <p> The 2023 Dodge Durango SRT Hellcat has room for six passengers in its cabin and 710 horses under its hood, making it one of the world’s quickest ways to ferry the kids to school. The Durango’s supersized powertrain is accompanied by a bulging body with styling inspired by Dodge’s muscle cars.
