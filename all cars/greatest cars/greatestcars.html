                Supercars
                of the
                2010s</h1>
            <p>This is our second article in a series of posts about the awesome cars of the 2010s. We curate the best
                supercars, exotics and hypercars from the 2010s. This past decade was stacked with masterpieces and it
                is
                indeed a good time to be a performance car fan.</p>
            <p>One of the defining moments of the 2010s supercar era was the 1,200 horsepower Bugatti 16/4 Veyron Super
                Sport smashing the previous McLaren F1 top speed record. Bugatti came out with the engineering marvel
                that
                was the Veyron and all of a sudden the word “supercar” no longer seemed quite enough to describe how
                much
                better it was that we had to invent the term “hypercar” to best encapsulate it. </p>
            <p>The 2010s were definitely about these new hypercars. We had no fewer than a half-dozen hypercars launched
                this decade. Major manufacturers gave us the Porsche 918 Spyder, McLaren P1 and Ferrari LaFerrari while
                the
                upstarts delivered equally tasty hypercars in the form of the Koenigsegg Regera and Pagani Huayra BC.
                With
                these hypercars came hybrid powertrains, powerful electronics and advanced technologies that we all
                expect
                to make their way into the everyday cars we drive tomorrow. </p>
            <p>The 2010s will also be remembered for things like McLaren coming out of nowhere to become a pre-eminent
                supercar company. Prior to the start of the decade you could look at the historical McLaren model list
                and
                find only two production models (the M6GT and F1) and by the end of the decade McLaren had launched no
                less
                than 22 incremental models. People can make fun of this product onslaught all they want, but the McLaren
                Senna, 675LT, P1 and 600LT are all worthy of their spot on this best supercars of the decade list. </p>
            <p>As always we will take a moment to help you understand our thinking. Firstly, in most cases we chose one
                model from a range to make our list. For example, we love all the Lamborghini Aventador variants, but it
                is
                clear that the final Aventador SVJ is the best by a wide margin so it made our list ahead of the other
                variants that are equally worthy. Second, we focused on production cars and stayed away from concept
                cars
                and tuner cars, as well as any cars that were announced but were not launched in the 2010s (that means
                we
                excluded a lot of the most anticipated upcoming hypercars like the Koenigsegg Jesko and Mercedes-AMG
                Project
                One). Third, our definition of exotic (the lowest level on this list) was around the $150k mark. If a
                car
                was under $150k when new then it is considered a sportscar and will be on that list. If it is more than
                $150k then it belongs on this best 2010s supercar list. </p>
            <p>With that, here are our picks for the best supercars from the last decade.</p>
            <h1>2010s Best Supercars</h1>
            <p>Read on for our ranked list of the greatest supercars of the twenty-tens. We discussed whether to rank
                the
                cars versus just have an unranked list and realized it was way more fun to have people argue about
                rankings
                than not.</p>

            <img src="Bugatti_164VeyronSuperSport14.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Wolfsburg/Molsheim, July 4, 2010 – on a beautiful sunny day at 25 degrees the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super
                Sport
                achieved a new landspeed world record for production cars, on the proving grounds of the Volkswagen
                Group at
                Ehra-Lessien (nearby its headquarters at Wolfsburg). In the presence of the German Technical Inspection
                Agency (TÜV) and a representative of Guinness Book of Records the Super Sport achieved an average top
                speed
                of 431 km/h.</p>

            <img src="Lamborghini-Sesto-Elemento.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Lamborghini is redefining the future of the super sports car with a unique technology demonstrator.
                Boasting an extremely lightweight construction thanks to advanced carbon-fiber technology, the
                Lamborghini Sesto Elemento has an overall curb weight of just 999 kilograms (2,202 lb) – including V10
                power unit and permanent all-wheel drive. This makes the Sesto Elemento a unique demonstration of the
                technological expertise of Automobili Lamborghini. Innovative carbon-fiber technologies are being used
                here for the first time in an automotive application. As a 100 percent subsidiary of AUDI AG, the
                Italian carmaker also benefits from the undisputed expertise of the German manufacturer when it comes to
                lightweight construction.</p>

            <h1>Ferrari 599 GTO</h1>
            <img src="Ferrari_599GTO.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Following cars such the 250 GTO or 288 GTO is not a task taken lightly. In their time, both were the
                ultimate expression of Ferrari aimed squarely at motor sport, so how can 599 GTO currently compare?.
                Really, it can’t. The 599 doesn’t have the same motor sport aspirations as the other GTOs and the name
                would probably be more appropriate for the 599XX track day version. What the new model does showcase is
                what the 599 should have been from its onset in 2006. The Larger brakes, more power and better
                aerodynamics ensure that the entire edition of 599 cars will be sold with little fuss.</p>

            <img src="Lamborghini_MurcilagoLP6704SuperVeloce1-1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Lamborghini Murciélago is one of the most extraordinary super sports cars of all time. Automobili
                Lamborghini has now expanded its model range with a new, exceptionally purist and even more extreme top
                model – the Murciélago LP 670-4 SuperVeloce is even more powerful, lighter and faster than the
                Murciélago LP 640. With the output of the 6.5 liter V12 increased to 670 hp and a weight reduction of
                100 kg (220 lbs), the Murciélago LP 670-4 SuperVeloce boasts a power-to-weight ratio of 2.3 kg (5.1 lbs)
                per hp. This catapults it from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in a breathtaking 3.2 seconds and powers it on to
                a top speed of around 342 km/h (212 mph). Distinctive design refinements ensure that each of this
                350-unit limited edition series conveys its full potential from the very first glance.</p>

            <p>Stephan Winkelmann, President and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., is presenting at the Volkswagen
                Group Night in Frankfurt the most extreme Gallardo ever: the Gallardo LP 570-4 Super Trofeo Stradale.
                Automobili Lamborghini is bringing motor racing excitement directly to the road. This new and most
                extreme top model in the Gallardo lineup is based on the successful race car from the Lamborghini
                Blancpain Super Trofeo, the world’s fastest singlemake series.</p>
            <p>The car will be produced in a limited run of 150 numbered units. The Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo
                championship brings professional racers and gentlemen drivers face-to-face in fiercely fought battles on
                Europe’s most challenging racetracks such as Monza, Silverstone and Hockenheim. There are many
                similarities between the racing and road versions of this super sports car. For example, they both share
                the same V10 powerplant, which is used in the racing version with no modifications.</p>

            <p>The McLaren MP4-12C is revealed as the first in a range of high-performance sports cars from McLaren
                Automotive, the independent car division based at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, England. The
                12C, and future models within the range, will challenge the world’s best sports cars, benefiting from
                the expertise and virtuosity of the McLaren Group.</p>
            <p>Twenty years of sports car design, engineering and production combined with inspirational success in
                Formula 1 have driven Ron Dennis, McLaren Automotive Chairman, to announce his plans for the ultimate
                line-up of technology-led and customer-focused performance cars for the 21st century. The rules in the
                sports car world are about to be re-written.
            </p>
            <p>Through a rich modern history, McLaren’s automotive division has already built the world’s most
                critically acclaimed supercar, the McLaren F1 (1993-1998) and the world’s best-selling luxury supercar,
                the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren (2003-2009). McLaren Automotive now looks to the future with a new range
                of revolutionary sports cars.</p>

            <img src="Aston Martin One-77.jpg" alt="">
            <p>After three years of teasers and prototypes, Aston Martin put the One-77 into production in early 2011.
                This completely hand-built supercar is the ultimate expression of what Aston Martin can produce and is
                offered as an alternative to the Bugatti Veyron.</p>
            <p>

                The car uses a carbon fiber tub from Multimatic of Canada in combination with an aluminum body. The DB9
                engine was modified by Cosworth and enlarged to 7.3 liters. New cylinder heads were produced to optimize
                flow and as a result, Aston Martin are currently making the most powerful normally aspirated engine on
                the market.</p>

            <p> Design director Marek Reichman worked closely with Ulrich Bez who wanted the ultimate Aston Martin
                supercar. He requested 700 bhp in less than 1500 kg with the classic front engine/rear wheel drive
                layout Aston Martin is famous for.</p>

            <h1>Ferrari F12 Berlinetta</h1>
            <img src="Ferrari F12 Berlinetta.jpg" alt="">
            <p>F12berlinetta is the third-generation Ferrari GT which follows the 599 GTB Fiorano and 550 Maranello.
                When released, Ferrari called it the fastest Ferrari ever built and cited a lap time around Fiorano of
                1’23”.</p>
            <p>Every aspect of the F12 improves upon the specification of the 599 GTB Fiorano. This includes upgrades to
                engine power, aerodynamics, fuel consumption, chassis rigidity, safety and luggage access with a new
                rear hatch.</p>
            <p>The car is built with an aluminum alloy space frame structure with a body styled jointly by Pininfarina
                and Ferrari’s own style center. Many elements are taken from the Ferrari FF released at the 2011 Geneva
                Motor Show.</p>
            <p>A highlight of the car is its 65º V12 engine which produces 750 bhp without the aid of turbochargers or
                superchargers. This unit uses variable timing and direct gasoline injection for improved efficiency.
                Power is sent to the rear wheels through a dual-clutch transmission and an active electronic
                differential.</p>

            <img src="Ford GT.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A 3.5-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 will be rated at 647 horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque. The GT
                will be paired exclusively to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and will apply all force to the
                rear wheels via a limited-slip differential. Cars & Driver got the GT from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.0
                seconds and through the quarter-mile in 10.8 seconds at 134 mph. Make no mistake, the GT is built for
                the track—not the streets. This goes to show that Ford can still build amazing supercars that are not
                just genuinely fast but truly innovative too. </p>

            <p>The biggest automotive concern on the planet could hardly stay out of a hypercar sparring match on the
                world stage, and with the Porsche 918 Spyder, VAG emphasized its strongest points in the hybrid against
                LaFerrari and the McLaren P1</p>
            <p>With the engineering might (and budget) of Porsche behind it, and drawing upon the company’s experience
                of racing hybrids in endurance racing, the 918 Spyder managed to undercut its rivals on price, while
                providing arguably the most complete road car package of the holy trinity.</p>
            <p>Appropriately, 918 examples of the Spyder were promised, with Porsche digging deep into its motorsport
                knowledge to produce technology that provided world-beating performance, as well as reducing fuel
                consumption.</p>
