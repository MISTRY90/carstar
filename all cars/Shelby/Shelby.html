        <h1>SHELBY AMERICAN </h1>
        <p>Shelby American, Inc. is an American high performance vehicle manufacturer founded by former race car driver
            Carroll Shelby. The Shelby American name has been used by several legally distinct corporations founded by
            Shelby since his original shop in Venice, California began operation in 1962. The current iteration is a
            wholly owned subsidiary of Carroll Shelby International, Inc. (OTC Pink: CSBI), a holding company formed in
            2003. Carroll Shelby International's other wholly owned subsidiary is Carroll Shelby Licensing, which
            licenses the name and trademarks associated with Shelby to other companies (including Shelby American).
            Shelby American was the first automobile manufacturer in the state of Nevada. Shelby American manufactures
            component automobiles, including replicas of the small-block and large-block AC Cobras, the Shelby GT350 and
            the GT500 Super Snake. Since 2005, Shelby American has released new models each year.
            In 1957 racing driver Carroll Shelby opened a sports car dealership in Dallas, with fellow racer Jim Hall
            and Hall's older brother Dick, selling Maseratis across the American Southwest. They raced Maseratis in the
            1957 SCCA National Sports Car Championship, while across the Atlantic Brian Lister's Lister Motor Company
            enjoyed racing success after installing a Jaguar XK engine in his sports cars. Shelby and Hall met Lister in
            England with the idea of swapping a Chevrolet small-block engine into the Lister body. They returned to
            Dallas with six cars, five of which they sold and the sixth they transplanted the Chevrolet engine into,
            which Hall raced in the SCCA National Championship. This was Shelby's first experience putting an American
            V8 engine into a British sports car body.
        </p>


        <p>With funding from oil driller and amateur racer Gary Laughlin, in 1959 Hall and Shelby approached General
            Motors with the idea of creating a new sports car using the Chevrolet Corvette chassis and engine, but with
            an aluminum body much lighter than the factory-built Corvette, in order to make a competitive touring car.
            Three cars were delivered and had new bodies designed by Carrozzeria Scaglietti installed, but after the
            initial three cars GM executives refused to sell them more rolling chassis, worried that the "Scaglietti
            Corvettes" would compete with GM's own car for sales
        </p>

        <p>Shelby continued sports cars racing in the late 1950s, competed in Formula 1 for Aston Martin in 1958 and
            1959, won the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 1960 USAC Road Racing Championship, but was forced into
            retirement following the 1960 season due to his persistent angina caused by a congenital heart defect.

            In 1961 Shelby founded the Shelby School of High Performance Driving at Riverside International Raceway near
            Los Angeles, hiring Pete Brock as a teacher, and obtained a distributorship for Goodyear tires and Champion
            spark plugs. He rented space for these other businesses from Dean Moon, at his shop Santa Fe Springs,
            California.

        <h2>Shelby American Logo</h2>
        <p>
            Back in the 60s, there was one sports car that cemented its name as an American icon. It was the AC Cobra.
            Shelby’s logo is traditionally a serpent too, and is said to have been designed so after a cobra appeared to
            Carroll Shelby, a racer and the designer who created the AC Cobra, in his sleep. Later on, North Korean car
            designer John Chun redesigned the logo so that it looked more menacing – coiled, fangs bared. This version
            is the most recognised of Shelby logos.

            <h4> Shelby GT</h4>
            <p>The iconic Shelby GT has returned with more power, performance and Shelby styling! The newly designed
                Shelby GT combines terrific handling, strong V8 power, muscular exhaust note, and handsome good looks.
                The naturally aspirated version produces 460 horsepower. The additional horsepower comes from a new
                exhaust, while a supercharger is available that can boost horsepower to 750HP*

                Shelby also worked with Ford Performance to tailor the suspension and maximize the car's capabilities,
                all without sacrificing ride quality. The exterior features proprietary bodywork and stylish new wheels,
                while Shelby touches can be found inside the sporty interior.

            <h4>The Shelby Raptor</h4>
            <p>The Shelby Raptor has returned and it is all business. Now available on the stronger, lighter and more
                nimble 2017-2018 platform, Shelby American turns the capable machine into an extreme off-roader with key
                enhancements to the truck’s suspension, power and styling.

                Under the hood, the Shelby Raptor has a custom cold-air performance intake system and tune, feeding the
                Ford Performance EcoBoost engine. This gives the twin-turbo V-6 an amazing 525+ horsepower and an
                astonishing 610+ foot pounds of torque.

            <h4>Shelby Super Snake</h4>
            <p>The Shelby Super Snake is back for 2022 with a fresh look and more refinement. Powered by an 825
                horsepower supercharged Ford 5.0L V8, the Super Snake launches from 0-60 in 3.5 seconds. With new
                suspension and brakes, it carves up the road course with ease. And yet it is so tractable, able to roll
                down the street like a king on its Shelby 20 inch one-piece forged aluminum wheels and high performance
                tires. Wide Body and suspension options are also available for the ultimate in style and handling.

            <h4> Shelby F-250</h4>
            <p>The Shelby F-250 Super Baja wears 18-inch alloy wheels bearing BFG KM3 37-inch tires, with a pair of
                spares mounted on a steel chase rack in the bed. The Shelby gets a functional Ram Air Hood with
                extraction vent, powder coated steel front and rear bumpers, tow points, chase rack and LED lighting
                around the truck. Features include painted front grille and fender flares, XL power steps with rock
                sliders and lights, bed liner, tinted windows and powder coated exhaust tips. Exterior Shelby stripes
                and badges proclaim the truck’s heritage.

            <h4>Shelby GT500SE</h4>
            <p>To enhance performance, Shelby American integrated a new pulley and coolers for the 5.2-liter V8 to churn
                out 800+ horsepower on 93 octane pump gas. The car is lowered with more track inspired springs to match
                a new aggressive suspension tune. A new ultra-light, vented dry carbon fiber hood cuts 30 pounds off the
                top of the Shelby GT500SE.

            <h4>Shelby Cobra</h4>
            <p>The big block Shelby Cobra is considered by many to be the most iconic American sports car in history.
                When GM began to work on a new big block Corvette and Ferrari increased the power of the V12 powered
                GTO's, Shelby and Ford Motor Company decided to shoehorn the mighty 427 FE motor into the Cobra..
