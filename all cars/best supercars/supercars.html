            <h2>Top 20 Supercars Of 2020 – The Coolest, Best & Most Exciting Cars In The World This Year</h2>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s that special time of the year again here at supercars.net! With the end of the
                2020 calendar year quickly approaching, we are back at it to present you with this year’s list of
                awesome cars, in our annual ‘best supercars & exotics’ list.</p>
            <p>This year in particular has been a special one, for more than a few reasons. Despite the current economic
                and social climate our world is enduring, our favorite automakers have persevered, if not managing to
                blow 2020 out of the water.</p>
            <p>There was no shortage of amazing automobiles being manufactured, delivered and enjoyed by customers
                throughout the year. By all accounts 2020 can be considered a relatively fruitful year in the supercar
                landscape; such automobiles as Porsche’s Taycan and new 911 Turbo S, McLaren’s 765 LT, Ferrari’s Roma
                and SF90 Stradale, Chevy’s new Corvette Stingray – and others to be mentioned – all making their debuts.
            </p>
            <p>Models from previous years also make it on the list, as they continue their production run into the 2020
                year with some updates and refreshes. Suffice to say, it is a big ask not to continue including cars
                such as the McLaren Senna, Ferrari F8 Tributo, Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and Aston Martin Valkyrie on
                this year’s list.</p>
            <p>2020 can also be considered the year, where we got the first real sneak peak into what the future of
                automobiles looks like with electrification on the horizon. It is just a matter of time before this
                becomes the norm even within the realm of exotic vehicles. However EVs such as the Porsche Taycan and
                hybrids such as the Ferrari SF90 Stradale are convincing ambassadors for the cause.</p>
            <p>We hope you enjoy this year’s compilation of the best supercars & exotics. Great efforts have been made
                to include every worthy automobile on this list without turning it into an encyclopedia for cars, and
                for this reason, some of your own personal choices may have been omitted. Anyway, see you again this
                time next year!</p>

            <h1>Ferrari SF90 Stradale</h1>
            <img src="Ferrari SF90 Stradale.jpg" alt="">
            <p>At first glance the SF90 Stradale sounds like a car we should all fear, a soul crushing proposition. It
                is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (Ferrari’s first) with four-wheel-drive, built on a new ‘multi
                material‘ platform and has even more electric driver aids than ever before. It is enough to make
                old-school Ferrari fans and drivers run straight for the exits (probably to pick up a 458 Speciale
                instead).</p>
            <p>Read on and you quickly realize that in addition to the (boring) electric drivetrain is the fact that the
                SF90 also has Ferrari’s most powerful V8 ever with an absurdly awesome 769 bhp. This 4 liter twin-turbo
                V8 when combined with the three electric motors gives the SF90 a total of almost 986 bhp, making the
                SF90 Ferrari’s most powerful road car ever.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>McLaren 765LT</h1>
            <img src="McLaren 765LT.jpg" alt="">
            <p>While the new McLaren 765LT technically isn’t out yet, it’s eventual release later this year was always
                going to be just a matter of time. The latest of the Woking manufacturer’s esteemed Long Tail variants
                is based on the already impressive 720S, and adds to a growing lineup of track-optimized McLaren
                supercars.</p>
            <p>Limited to a production run of just 765 units, the McLaren 765LT becomes the fifth member of the Long
                Tail roster, joining the 675LT, 675LT Spider, 600LT and 600LT Spider. Once those sell out, buyers will
                have to look forward to the (most probable) release of the Spider version which will follow shortly
                thereafter.</p>
            <p>The McLaren 765 LT is just beginning production, with the first deliveries expected late in 2020.</p>

            <h1>Porsche Taycan Turbo S</h1>
            <img src="Porsche Taycan Turbo S.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Porsche’s first EV is the statement car of 2020, proving that a future with electrification can still
                embody the soul of a true sports car in the Taycan Turbo and Taycan Turbo S. Shortly after their
                release, Porsche added a slightly detuned version of the Taycan in a trim level known as the Taycan 4S.
                The company will expand the Taycan lineup with even more versions, with a rear-wheel drive base model
                and a GTS version rumored to be in the works.</p>
            <p>With the introduction of the Taycan, we are ushered into a new age of Porsche cars and a new era for all
                automobiles. No longer are electric cars something that have to be a compromise. We’re just getting
                started, and things are only going to get better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA</h1>
            <img src="Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Speaking of statement cars, the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA is a pure badass and is the most impressive display
                of showmanship we have seen from the company in a very long time. Equipped with a unique
                twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V6 engine, the sedan is capable of completing a 0-60 mph sprint in just 3.6
                seconds.</p>
            <p>Pure power is definitely not the car’s calling card, but it is as track-ready and balanced as you would
                want any sports car to be. With a focus on aerodynamic, chassis, suspension and braking upgrades, the
                GTA will allow you to clip those apexes and ‘send it’ through the tight corners with great aplomb. The
                Giulia GTA will be available in two trims – the standard GTA and the GTAm – with the latter upping
                things a notch to ‘race car mode’ with a roll bar, carbon fiber bucket seats, Sabelt six-point racing
                harnesses, and a more aggressive arsenal of aerodynamics. Only 500 will be produced.</p>

            <h1>Pininfarina Battista</h1>
            <img src="Pininfarina Battista.jpg" alt="">
            <p>When the Pininfarina Battista was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2019, it was touted as the
                first fully-electric hypercar. Having been teased with bits and pieces up to that point, the Battista
                would finally secure its place in history as the first complete amalgamation of a zero-emissions
                hypercar.</p>
            <p>Like the car itself, delivery of the first examples are coming in faster than you can blink, with
                customers told to expect their cars no later than the third quarter of 2020. Before we know it, an
                automobile which could revolutionize the way we travel will be taking center stage.</p>
            <p>The Pininfarina Battista draws power from its four electric motors – one for each wheel, also making it
                AWD – which in combination, produce up to a mind-boggling 1,900-horsepower (or 1,400 kW). Thanks to its
                120kWh battery (which is rated 20kWh higher than Tesla’s Model X and Model S), the car is able to
                generate 1,696 lb-ft of torque (the equivalent of 2,300 Nm), with Pininfarina claiming 0-60 mph is
                possible in less than 2 seconds. A top speed of 217 mph is what is currently theorized. The
                aforementioned figures by these accounts, makes it faster than a Formula 1 race car.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1>Koenigsegg Gemera</h1>
            <img src="Koenigsegg Gemera.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Hinted at for a long time under the codename KG12, the latest Koenigsegg megacar has been revealed: The
                2021 Koenigsegg Gemera. The Gemera is Koenigsegg’s first proper 2+2 GT car, or, due to the power it
                produces, mega-GT.</p>
            <p>The car outputs a combined total of 1.27 MW of power, or 1,700 HP, and 2,581 lbs-ft of torque. This is
                achieved with a combination of an extremely powerful, 2.0 liter twin turbo camless freevalve inline
                three engine, nicknamed the Tiny Friendly Giant, that produces 600 HP all on its own that powers the
                front axle, combined with three electric motors.</p>
            <p>Two electric motors are placed at each rear wheel, with a third motor attached to the crankshaft of the
                engine to boost power to the front axle. All three motors have a combined output of 1,100 HP.</p>
            <p>Koenigsegg has confirmed that orders can be taken through the Expressions Of Interest website, and that
                the base price is $1.7 million USD.</p>

            <h1>Ferrari Roma</h1>
            <img src="Ferrari Roma.jpg" alt="">
            <p>It’s a front-engined car with a hardtop, and it’s one of the more beautiful cars the Prancing Horse has
                come out with recently. Inside the car, you can see that it’s one of the most high-tech cabins of any
                Ferrari.</p>
            <p>The specifications and details only exacerbate this. The car gets a turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 engine with
                new cap profiles and a speed sensor that allows the maximum rpm to rise by 5,000 rpm. In other words,
                this is an Italian Stallion that can truly sing. The engine has a single-piece exhaust manifold that’s
                designed to make the most of the engine’s efforts. All told, it makes 612 hp and 560 lb-ft of torque.
            </p>
            <p>Inside, you get what Ferrari calls 2+ seating, meaning the back seats (if you can call them that) are
                pretty much useful only for some luggage. There’s a new steering wheel with haptic controls, a 16-inch
                digital instrument cluster, an 8.4-inch infotainment system (it’s optional), and a passenger 8.8-inch
                widescreen display for settings and navigation. There are also many driver assistance systems, including
                adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind-spot detection, and
                cross-traffic alert.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</h1>
            <img src="Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Probably the most exciting thing to come from the American brand (and perhaps the entire automotive
                industry) for a long time, is the new mid-engine 2020 Chevrolet Corvette. In its most basic form, the
                car is equipped with a power plant which produces 490 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque.</p>
            <p>It is a purpose-built machine which signals Chevy’s intent to go full-tilt against the likes of exotic
                brands such as Porsche, Ferrari and McLaren on the performance front, while costing substantially less
                to own. The optional Z51 package takes the already capable base car, turning it into a worthy track
                machine with upgrades in the power and chassis department.</p>
            <p>The first iteration of the reborn Corvette is already on most journalists’ “Best of” lists, and there are
                no signs of the plaudits ending anytime soon. On paper, its bang-for-buck looks untouchable and
                potentially industry-disrupting. It comes in both coupe and convertible body styles with additional
                trims slated to be released throughout the lifecycle of the car.</p>

            <h1>McLaren Senna</h1>
            <img src="McLaren Senna.png" alt="">
            <p>Another returnee from last year’s version of this list, the McLaren Senna is just a car that won’t be
                denied being put on its pedestal. After all, the McLaren Senna is the pinnacle of McLaren performance.
                It combines the three principal matters of a high performance vehicle – aerodynamics, chassis and power
                – in an unrivaled manner.</p>
            <p>McLaren’s marketing team accurately sums things up, stating “The McLaren Senna is the personification of
                McLaren’s DNA at its most extreme, creating the purest connection between car and driver. It is the most
                track-focused road car we have ever built, and it will set the fastest lap times of any McLaren to date.
                That is what has driven us to build a track car that is unashamedly without compromise. One that is
                legalized for road use, but not sanitized to suit it. Nothing else matters but to deliver the most
                intense driving experience around a circuit.”</p>
            <p>As a purpose-built track car, it still manages to be road-legal; however, all 500 units have already been
                spoken for, so don’t expect to see one roaming the streets or hitting up the circuits with any
                preferable degree of frequency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>Ferrari F8 Tributo</h1>
            <img src="Ferrari F8 Tributo.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The 2020 Ferrari F8 Tributo is the latest and greatest V8-powered Berlinetta to be produced by the
                prancing horse marque. Considered ‘entry-level’ in the Ferrari model lineup, the F8 Tributo is
                nevertheless the greater of the sum of its parts; it is a highly capable all-rounder, standing out
                amongst an expanding club of ‘everyday supercars’.</p>
            <p>Elegant but not without a functional brawn to it, the mid-engine 710 hp F8 Tributo has an outstanding,
                yet purposeful appearance to match its disposition; especially as it relates to matters of
                tarmac-carving and apex-clipping.</p>
            <p>This Tributo is a nod to over 40 years of the latter’s existence, while also a soft confession that the
                F8 will likely be the last of its kind – Ferrari’s historic internal combustion V8 is next-in-line for
                the hybridisation treatment. The Ferrari F8 Tributo is a fitting celebration of this extensively storied
                history.</p>

            <h1>Lamborghini Aventador SVJ</h1>
            <img src="Lamborghini Aventador SVJ.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In late July 2018, the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ became the latest production car to break the lap record
                at the legendary testing ground that is the Nürburgring Nordschleife.</p>
            <p>It would be more than a month later before the car was officially unveiled to the public, during Monterey
                Car Week taking place in Pebble Beach, California. It was going to take nothing short of special to
                dethrone the Porsche 911 GT2 RS, and Lamborghini’s new flagship car is something beyond even that.</p>
            <p>To power its way around this treacherous course, the Aventador SVJ – available as both a coupe and
                roadster – employs a naturally aspirated 6.5L V12 engine which delivers 770-horsepower at 8,500 rpm and
                530 lb-ft of torque at 6,750 rpm to its all-wheel-drive system. It is able to do 0-100 km/h in only 2.8
                seconds and has a top speed of over 349 km/h.</p>
            <p>On the street, the car is remarkably civil and suffers no loss of character or fun factor. Simply one of
                the greatest road cars available right now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>Bugatti Divo</h1>
            <img src="Bugatti Divo.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Bugatti Divo is based on the Bugatti Chiron, and is certainly no less over-the-top. The Divo shares
                most of the important mechanical features with the Chiron; most notably the same quad-turbocharged 8.0L
                W16 engine which produces an extravagant 1,500 horsepower.</p>
            <p>However, to make the Divo “the most agile and dynamic car Bugatti has ever created“ drastic changes
                elsewhere have made the two cars otherwise very distinguishable from one another. Functional air inlets
                were added to the front bonnet, along with a NACA duct on the roof, and a larger adjustable rear
                spoiler. The headlights and tail lights were reimagined for further effect, while its lower stance
                suggests added performance purpose. The interior is least affected, with some finishing touches added to
                make it distinctive.</p>
            <p>Overall the Divo also has sharper angles and more aggressive looking body lines, with the horseshoe
                shaped grill, centre line running over the top of the car, and scoop-shaped doors being the only truly
                pronounced Bugatti features. The remaining design elements seem fairly reminiscent of present day
                Lamborghinis – and the fact that Mr. Winkelmann is the former Automobili Lamborghini CEO, leads me to
                believe this may not be much of a coincidence.</p>
            <p>Only 40 are going to be produced, and they’re already sold out.</p>
