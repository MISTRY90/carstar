        <h1>JAGUAR </h1>
        <p>Jaguar, a British multinational car manufacturer with its headquarters in Whitley, Coventry, England. Jaguar
            Cars was the company that was responsible for the production of Jaguar cars until its operations were fully
            merged with those of Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover on 1 January 2013.</p>
        <p>
            Jaguar's business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars
            before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under the ownership of S. S. Cars Limited, the business
            extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Co, many bearing Jaguar as a model name.
            The company's name was changed from S. S. Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor
            Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings
            (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be
            nationalised in 1975.</p>
        <p>
            Jaguar was spun off from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, becoming a
            constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until it was acquired by Ford in 1990.[5] Jaguar has, in recent years,
            manufactured cars for the British Prime Minister, the most recent delivery being an XJ in May 2010. The
            company also holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles.
        </p>


        <p>The Swallow Sidecar Company was founded in 1922 by two motorcycle enthusiasts, William Lyons and William
            Walmsley. In 1934 Walmsley elected to sell-out and in order to buy the Swallow business (but not the company
            which was liquidated) Lyons formed S.S. Cars Limited, finding new capital by issuing shares to the public.
        </p>

        <p>Jaguar first appeared in September 1935 as a model name on an SS 2½-litre sports saloon. A matching
            open two seater sports model with a 3½-litre engine was named SS Jaguar 100.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 23 March 1945, the S. S. Cars shareholders in general meeting agreed to change the company's name to
            Jaguar Cars Limited. Said chairman William Lyons "Unlike S. S. the name Jaguar is distinctive and cannot be
            connected or confused with any similar foreign name."

        <h2>The Jaguar Logo</h2>
        <p>
            The Jaguar car logo is one of the best-known vehicle symbols in the world. Currently owned by Tata Motors,
            Jaguar has built its image as a powerful manufacturer of luxurious, sporty cars over the decades.</p>
        <p>
            Today, the Jaguar emblem is known as the “Leaper”, and it features a sleek, jumping Jaguar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instantly recognisable on the hood of any vehicle, the Jaguar “Leaper” is a beautiful, yet simple image.
            Usually present in silver or chrome on a car but shared in shades of black and white in marketing materials,
            the symbol is sleek and sophisticated.</p>

            <p>
                The first generation was marketed as the XK8, replacing the XJS and was Jaguar's first 8-cylinder model

                chassis conceived in the mid-1980s. The second generation of the XK, noted for its aluminium monocoque
                chassis and construction, was launched in 2006 for the 2007 model year. The XKR performance variant was
                introduced in both of the generations with the second generation also offering a more powerful XKR-S
                variant. </p>

            <h4>Jaguar Piranag</h4>
            <p>The Bertone Pirana (or Jaguar Pirana) is a concept car created by Bertone for the 1967 London Motor Show
                at Earl's Court. The sleek GT car was based on the chassis and powertrain of the 4.2 litre Jaguar
                E-type, with a unique steel semi-monocoque body and luxurious interior. It was officially named
                "Pirana," not "Piranha" as some sources describe, although the badge on the rear of the car reads
                Piranha. This spelling was reportedly an aesthetic choice.[1] The Pirana was designed by Marcello
                Gandini, perhaps best known for styling the Lamborghini Countach. Unusually for a show car, the Pirana
                was commissioned by The Daily Telegraph, a leading British daily newspaper, as an example of an "ideal
                car.
