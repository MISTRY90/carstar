            We couldn’t care less what lap time cars can do at the Nurburgring, or how much they weighs, or whether there are those who will typecast its driver. We want cars that are joyous to drive, purely for the sake of driving. We want escapism that if were brutally honest, probably won’t be possible much longer. For us, it is about an enjoyment, excitement and fascination with cars that deliver unique and precious driving experiences.
