        <h1>[2022 Edition] Current Porsche Model Lineup</h1>
        <p>Few automobile companies have mastered the dynamics of the performance car segment like Porsche. The German
            carmaker, leveraging its wealth of experience, has something to offer a wide variety of customers, from
            those seeking a capable daily driver to those requiring a hardcore performance machine. Porsche currently
            offers almost 90 different vehicles in various trims and configurations! That number is distributed among a
            lineup that includes the 718 Cayman, 718 Boxster, 911 (992), Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and all-electric
            Taycan. Then you also have the extensive options available through its Exclusive Manufaktur program - one
            that allows customers to create a truly unique vehicle.</p>
        <p>It is a strategy that has worked well for Porsche, and the carmaker rolled into 2022 on the back of another
            strong 2021 showing. The automobile company delivered a record 301,915 vehicles in 2021, representing an 11%
            increase over 2020. The American continent accounted for the most significant gains, but China continues to
            lead as Porsche's biggest single market.</p>
        <p>The lineup has gained notable additions for 2022 to help Porsche maintain its strong showing. The new 911
            (992) sports car is the best yet, loaded with performance and character. The model offering has been
            expanded with new variants like the Turismo trim for the Taycan and Panamera. The brand has also made
            significant investments in its EV program and is set to follow the launch of the wildly successful Taycan
            with the Macan EV. Prototypes have already been spotted testing, and an official reveal could happen
            sometime in 2022.</p>

            <h2>2022 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS</h2>
            <img src="./porsche/2022 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS.webp" alt="">
            <ul>
                <li>Base Price: $141,700</li>
                <li>Engine: 4-litre Naturally Aspirated Flat 6</li>
                <li>Power: 493 hp @ 8,400 rpm</li>
                <li>Torque: 331 lb-ft @ 6,250 rpm</li>
                <li>0-60 mph: 3.2 seconds</li>
                <li>Top Speed: 196 mph</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The GT4 RS is the newest addition to the Cayman family. It does not come cheap but that extra premium
                gets you a car with blistering performance and a screaming naturally aspirated engine that can rev all
                the way to 9,000 rpm.</p>

            <h2> 2022 Porsche 718 Boxster</h2>
            <img src="./porsche/2022 Porsche 718 Boxster.jpg" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li>Base Price: $62,600</li>
                    <li>Engine: 2-litre Turbocharged boxer 4</li>
                    <li>Power: 300 hp @ 6,500 rpm</li>
                    <li>Torque: 280 lb-ft @ 1,950 – 4,500 rpm</li>

                    <li>Top Speed: 170 mph</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The base Boxster is a performance bargain. At its heart is a turbocharged four cylinder engine with adequate torque and power for the small chassis. This is a mid-engined roadster you can enjoy everyday.</p>

            <h2>2022 Porsche 911 GT3</h2>
            <img src="./porsche/2022 Porsche 911 GT31.jpg" alt="">
            <ul>
                <li>Base Price: $161,000</li>
                <li>Engine: 4.0-litre Naturally Aspirated Flat-6</li>
                <li>Power: 502 hp @ 8,400 rpm</li>
                <li>Torque: 346 lb-ft @ 6,100 rpm</li>
                <li>0-60 mph: 3.2 seconds</li>
                <li>Top Speed: 197 mph</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This one is new for the 2022 model year. Porsche has continued the use of the naturally-aspirated 4.0L 9A1 flat-6 power plant in the 2022 Porsche 911 GT3. The only key differences between the engine used in the race car and the one used in the 992 GT3, are the exhaust system and ECU. This new GT3 is the seventh iteration of one of Porsche’s most established and beloved automobiles.</p>

            <h2>2022 Porsche Taycan</h2>
            <img src="./porsche/2022 Porsche Taycan.jpg" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li>Base Price: US$82,700</li>
                    <li>Engine: AC Permanent Synchronous Motors</li>
                    <li>Power: 321hp (402 hp Overboost Power with Launch Control)</li>

                    <li>Range: 225 miles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Taycan is powered by a standard 79.2-kWh battery and a rear permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor that makes 402 horsepower, though a 93.4-kWh battery is an option. It increases power to 469 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. 0-to-60-mph is achieved in 5.1 seconds with launch control and top speed is rated at 143 mph.</p>
